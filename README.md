# Simple test of the Central Limit Theorem

A program to test the CLT through experimentation.

Steps: 

* Generates a set of random numbers.
* Takes a large number of samples from the population
* The expectation is that 68.27% of the sample means will be within +/- 1 times the Standard Error

Standard Error = Standard Deviation of Sampling Distribution

Standard Error = (Population Standard Deviation) / (sqrt(Sample Size))

After running a million trials, the accuracy was accurate within 0.01 percent.
